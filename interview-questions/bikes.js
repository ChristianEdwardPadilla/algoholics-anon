// You are given a googler and multiple points of interest on a grid.  These
// points of interests are other Googlers and bikes.  There is the catch that
// if a specific googler is closer to the bike, that bike is considered
// unavailable (meaning the bike has been claimed).  Task is to find the
// manhattan distance between the googler and the closest available bike. The
// input data can be in whatever format you see fit.
